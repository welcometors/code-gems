Reinforment Learning
======================

---

## Projects

* [__nArmedBandit__](./nArmedBandit/)  
  Classic n-armed bandit problem with e-greedy and softmax policies.

* [__bellman__](./bellman/)  
  Some problems listed in the 4th Chapter of 
  <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning" target="_blank">
  "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Sutton & Barto</a>.

* [__randomWalk__](./randomWalk/)  
  Some classic reinforment techniques like monte-carlo, sarsa, q-learning, 
  TD-lambda.

* [__cpplib__](./cppLib/)  
  A wrapper for RLcpp library (c++ implementation of some RL algorithms).
  This is optional, as all the projects has pure python implementation.
