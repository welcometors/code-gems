Smallest multiple

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

Solution:
let the solution be n
let S is the set of all primes less than 20
then for each element s of S there will be floor(log(20 base s)) appearences of s in prime facterization of n
